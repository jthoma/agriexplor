* Wild chilli ripened (Kerala kanthari red) 200 gm
* Lemon juice from one lemon or 10ml

## Process
Grind all of the ingredients together, take care not to squeeze it, make a lump out of it, about 900 to 1000 gm dissolve in 8 liters of fresh water (chlorine free) and after sifting through cotton cloth use hand sprayer to spray on to plant leaves on alternate days.
